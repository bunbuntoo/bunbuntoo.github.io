description: From three bunnies, to a mission that goes beyond.
---
Hi, I’m Yuki, the founder of BunBunTOO, a project born out of my personal journey of love, loss and learning. I lost my beloved rabbit, Otis, and through this heartbreaking experience, I became more determined to learn as much as I could about proper rabbit care to look after [my bunnies](../../bunnies){:target="_blank"}. However, as I explored, I discovered a troubling truth: many rabbits around the world are not properly cared for, and the attitudes toward them vary drastically depending on where you are. The awareness of this situation filled me with deep sadness and sparked a strong desire to make a change.

Through my experiences and research, I’ve come to deeply admire Germany's animal welfare philosophy, where animals are seen as beings with inherent dignity, not as possessions. This philosophy has deeply shaped my approach to animal care. I aim to share the science-based rabbit care practices I’ve learned and improve the lives of rabbits everywhere. Yet, my mission extends beyond rabbits. I firmly believe that all animals, big and small, deserve respect, compassion, and care. Through the content shared on this platform, I hope to promote these values and advocate for a more compassionate approach to all beings.

This project may have started with me, but I hope it will grow into something that belongs to everyone who cares — a shared effort for the future.
