description: From three bunnies, to a mission that goes beyond.
---
Hi, I’m Yuki, the founder of BunBunTOO, a project born out of my personal journey of love, loss and learning. I lost my beloved rabbit, Otis, and through this heartbreaking experience, I became more determined to learn as much as I could about proper rabbit care. As I explored, I discovered a troubling truth: many rabbits around the world are not properly cared for, and the attitudes toward them vary drastically depending on where you are. This lack of awareness and understanding filled me with deep sadness and sparked a strong desire to make a change.

Through my research and experiences, I’ve come to deeply admire the animal welfare philosophy practiced in Germany, where animals are viewed as beings with their own dignity, not simply as possessions of humans. I want to share the science-based rabbit care practices I’ve learned and help improve the lives of rabbits everywhere. However, my mission extends beyond rabbits — it's about all animals. I firmly believe that animals, big and small, deserve to be treated with respect, compassion, and care. I aim to promote these values through the content shared on this platform, while advocating for a more compassionate approach to all beings.

This project may have started with me, but I hope it will grow into something that belongs to everyone who cares — a shared effort for the future.
