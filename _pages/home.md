## About Project
**BunBunTOO** is a project born out of love -- created to spread kindness and care for rabbits everywhere. We share science-backed knowledge and practices to help raise awareness and make life better for bunnies around the world. Our mission is to promote rabbit welfare and, more broadly, animal well-being -- encouraging love and respect for all creatures, big and small.

So, what’s behind the name **BunBunTOO**? It’s a playful twist on “bunnies, too,” rooted in the belief that animals, just like us, are individuals worthy of care, respect, and dignity. The name also comes from three special bunnies: Teddy, Orelie, and Otis — whose presence marks the beginning of this journey.

Curious about where all this starts? Find out more in [Our Story](./story).
