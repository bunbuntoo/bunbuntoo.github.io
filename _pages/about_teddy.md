Teddy's Story:  
Before joining our family, Teddy lived alone. Without a fellow bunny companion, he spent much of his time in a cage, when no one was home. Though he was affectionate and loved people, it was clear he longed for a friend of his own kind. His previous family, hoping for a better life for him, posted his information online. After waiting for a while, Teddy found his way to us when we were searching for a companion for Orelie. He and Orelie met, had a brief scuffle, and quickly grew close, sharing a joyful companionship. Teddy now brings warmth and happiness to our home, and we’re so grateful he found us.
