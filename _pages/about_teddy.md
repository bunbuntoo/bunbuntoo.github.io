Teddy's Story:  
Before joining our family, Teddy lived alone. Without a fellow bunny companion, he spent much of his time in a cage, especially when no one was home. Though he was affectionate and loved people, it was clear he longed for a friend of his own kind. He would chase his ball by himself and sometimes lost his appetite when left alone.   

His previous family, wanting to give him a better life, posted his information online, hoping someone with another rabbit might welcome him. Teddy waited for a while—young bunnies were more easily chosen—but eventually, the timing was just right. We were searching for a companion for Orelie, and that’s how Teddy came into our lives.

He and Orelie met, had a tiny scuffle, and soon after began grooming each other. They quickly grew close, and now they share a warm and joyful companionship. Teddy’s presence brings light and laughter into the home, and we’re grateful every day that he found his way to us.
