Orelie's Story:  
Orelie and Otis were siblings who arrived at our home together, growing up side by side in a world full of love and companionship. Their bond was a beautiful, silent understanding. Tragically, Otis passed away. Orelie seemed a little lost ‚Äî without her brother to groom her, her fur became a bit messy, and something subtle in her rhythm had changed. But life has a way of gently moving forward, and before long, she met Teddy. They became friends, and as their bond quickly deepened, Orelie and Teddy now share a deep connection, embarking on a new chapter together.
