Otis's Story:  
Otis was the quiet protector of the group — gentle, caring, and cautious. He looked after his sister Orelie with care and patience, grooming her and watching over their world. Though he didn’t like head pats, he stayed close, calm and loyal, leaving behind a quiet warmth that still lingers. He loved exploring new places, with a few secret spots on his mind, and would cheekily nibble the wall or sneak a treat when no one was watching.

In Loving Memory:  
Otis left us on March 22, 2025. He may have been quiet, but his presence spoke volumes in all the best ways. He didn’t need to ask for love; he simply stayed close. We miss him dearly, and he’ll always be part of our home.
