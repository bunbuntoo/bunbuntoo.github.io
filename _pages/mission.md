description: From three bunnies, to a mission that goes beyond.

## 🌱 Our Mission
BunBunTOO is a non-profit, knowledge-based project dedicated to the health and welfare of rabbits. Our mission is to collect, translate, and present science-based rabbit care knowledge in an accessible, multilingual, and friendly format — for both bunny lovers and animal advocates around the world.

## 🐾 Why This Project Exists
This initiative was born from both personal experience and observation. While caring for my beloved house rabbits, I encountered challenges that many rabbit owners face:

- Limited access to reliable information
- Language barriers in veterinary resources
- Confusion around behavioral issues and welfare standards

After seeing my rabbits thrive in a more natural, socially enriched environment, I realized how deeply environment and understanding affect their wellbeing — and how little support exists in many languages.

BunBunTOO is my response to that gap: a space for shared knowledge, empathy, and improved rabbit care.

## 🌟 What We Do
- Build a knowledge base of rabbit diseases, symptoms, and care protocols
- Translate high-quality resources (especially from German veterinary literature) into English and Chinese
- Visualize welfare standards and data through accessible charts and summaries
- Design multilingual content to lower the entry barrier for rabbit care
- Promote animal welfare through clear, respectful, and science-based information

## 🌍 Our Vision
We believe that rabbits — often misunderstood and underestimated — deserve the same respect, empathy, and care as any companion animals.

Our long-term goals include:
- Raising awareness of proper rabbit welfare standards
- Bridging the language gap in animal care literature
- Empowering rabbit caregivers and communities with trustworthy, open-access knowledge
- Promoting a broader understanding of animal welfare that extends beyond rabbits to all animals in our care
